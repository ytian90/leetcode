 * <p>
 * You have a passage of text that needs to be typed out, but some of the letter keys on your keyboard are broken!
 * You are given an array letters representing the working letter keys, as well as a string text, and your task is
 * to determine how many of the words from text can be typed using the broken keyboard. It is guaranteed that all
 * of the non-letter keys are working (including all punctuation and special characters).
 * A word is defined as a sequence of consecutive characters which does not contain any spaces.
 * The given text is a string consisting of words, each separated by exactly one space.
 * It is guaranteed that text does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
 * Note that the characters in letters are all lowercase, but since the shift key is working,
 * it's possible to type the uppercase versions also.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * 1. For text = "Hello, this is CodeSignal!" and letters = ['e', 'i', 'h', 'l', 'o', 's'],
 * the output should be brokenKeyboard(text, letters) = 2.
 * - "Hello," can be typed since the characters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' are in letters.
 * - Note that the symbol ',' also belongs to the current word and can by typed.
 * - "this" cannot be typed because the character 't' is not in letters.
 * - "is" can be typed (both 'i' and 's' appear in letters).
 * - "CodeSignal!" cannot be typed because the character 'c' is not in letters (as well as 'd', 'g', 'n', and 'a').
 * 2. For text = "Hi, this is Chris!" and letters = ['r', 's', 't', 'c', 'h'], the output should be
 * brokenKeyboard(text, letters) = 0.
 * - Each word contains the character 'i' which does not appear in letters and thus cannot be typed on the keyboard.
 * 3. For text = "3 + 2 = 5" and letters = [], the output should be brokenKeyboard(text, letters) = 5.
 * - There are no working letters on the keyboard, but since each of these words consists of numbers and
 * special characters, they can all be typed, and there are 5 of them.
