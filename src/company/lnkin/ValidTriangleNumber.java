/**
 * LC 611. Valid Triangle Number
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Valid combinations are:
 * 2,3,4 (using the first 2)
 * 2,3,4 (using the second 2)
 * 2,2,3
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
 * Output: 4

     * some analysis and explanation:
     * our target is a+b>c, so there are two ways to implement 3 pointers method - suppose the three pointers are i, j and k, where i < j < k:
     * we fix the first pointer i and make j = i+1, k = n-1, if a[i]+a[j]>a[k], then there are k-j combinations that satisfy a+b>c.
     * however, if a[i]+a[j]<=a[k], based on the condition, we have two options: 1) j++, OR 2) k--
     * the problems will happen right here - if we are considering all the combinations - the solution is becoming O(N^3) again.
     * if we just simply move j, we are missing the cases where the third pointer between j and k
