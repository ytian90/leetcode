/**
 * LC 127. Word Ladder
 *
 * A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
 *
 * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
 * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
 * sk == endWord
 * Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
