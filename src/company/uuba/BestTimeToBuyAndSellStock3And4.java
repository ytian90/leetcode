/**
 * LC 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.
 *
 * Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
 * Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
 * Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: prices = [1]
 * Output: 0
