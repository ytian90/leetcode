/**
 * LC 757. Set Intersection Size At Least Two
 *
 * An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.
 *
 * Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
 * Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
 * Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: An example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 3000
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai < bi <= 108
