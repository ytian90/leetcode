	 * If we sort all the numbers into buckets indexed by these numbers, this is essentially asking you to repetitively take an bucket while giving up the 2 buckets next to it. (the range of these numbers is [1, 10000])

		The optimal final result can be derived by keep updating 2 variables skip_i, take_i, which stands for:
		skip_i : the best result for sub-problem of first (i+1) buckets from 0 to i, while you skip the ith bucket.
		take_i : the best result for sub-problem of first (i+1) buckets from 0 to i, while you take the ith bucket.

		DP formula:
		take[i] = skip[i-1] + values[i];
		skip[i] = Math.max(skip[i-1], take[i-1]);
		take[i] can only be derived from: if you skipped the [i-1]th bucket, and you take bucket[i].
		skip[i] through, can be derived from either take[i-1] or skip[i-1], whatever the bigger;
